# Algorithms and Data Structures Project 2021
Final project for the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'informatica" course.

## Requirements
This year's projects requires to score given graphs based on shortest path to the base node, and print the indexes of the "best" graphs when required. 
The first line of the input must contain two numbers: D, the number of nodes in each graph, and K, the number of "best" graphs to print when prompted 
> The full specifications can be found in the *GraphRanker.pdf* file, along with an example of execution
